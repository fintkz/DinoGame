# Dinosaur Game 

## Game Overview

This project is a JavaScript implementation of a simple side-scrolling game inspired by the popular "Dinosaur Game" found in web browsers. The game is built using the p5.js library, which provides a convenient framework for creating interactive graphics and games.

In this game, players control a dinosaur character that must jump over obstacles as they approach. The game continues indefinitely, with the difficulty increasing over time. The objective is to survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score.

## Key Features

1. **Dinosaur Character**: A player-controlled character that can jump to avoid obstacles.
2. **Obstacle Generation**: Randomly generated obstacles that the dinosaur must avoid.
3. **Scoring System**: Tracks the current score and maintains a high score.
4. **Difficulty Progression**: The frequency of obstacles increases over time, making the game progressively more challenging.
5. **Game Over State**: Detects collisions between the dinosaur and obstacles, ending the game when a collision occurs.
6. **Restart Functionality**: Allows players to restart the game after a game over by pressing the spacebar or tapping the screen.
7. **Visual Elements**: Uses basic shapes and an imported dinosaur image for visual representation.

## Technical Aspects

- The game uses p5.js for rendering graphics and handling user input.
- Object-oriented programming concepts are employed, with separate classes for the dinosaur and obstacles.
- The game loop continuously updates the game state, including obstacle movement, collision detection, and score tracking.
- Keyboard and mouse/touch inputs are supported for jumping and restarting the game.



Overall, this project serves as a solid foundation for a simple yet engaging browser-based game built by me to learn js
